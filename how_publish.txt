Consider publishing the app as a self-contained executable 
so the user doesn't need to install the .NET runtime:

Run the following in your project folder:
cmd
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
This generates an .exe file for your application in the bin/Release folder. 
Replace the .bat file with the .exe for simpler execution.
With this approach:

The .exe file will launch the app directly, removing dependency on the dotnet command.
You can still include logic within the app to open the browser automatically.
